    <h1>The Story of teaching a old dog new tricks (PAGE heading)</h1>
    
    <h2>In general it is fair to say that younger minds find it easier to learn than older minds. We know that surveys suggest that the average IT Pro, in their early 40’s, is no longer a spring chicken. Some assume that this means they aren’t all that good at learning. The reality is that anyone who is an IT Pro would have to already be pretty good at learning simply because it would be next to impossible to stay in the industry for more than a decade unless you were able to pick stuff up pretty quickly. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>

      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
