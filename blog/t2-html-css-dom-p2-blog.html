           <h3>What is a grid based design?</h3>
      
          <p>In general human eyes follows certain pattern when looking at things like starting from left to right and then from top to bottom. Based on this natural attribute a webpage is also designed to have heading and some images to the left and descriptive text to the right and flow from top to bottom. This type of a design is what is known as grid based layout.</p>

          <h3> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>

          <p>These days the way we access web content is not limited to the traditional desktop pc but on multiple devices like tablet and mobile phones. All these have different screen resolutions. So when a webpage has to be designed in such a way that the contents should be read legible, readable and importantly the methodused for page manipulation like a mouse or finger tip. This what is called a responsive webpage design. </p>

          <h3>Semantic structure</h3>
          
          <p>If you imagine  HTML as a language then the tags like <b>head, main, section, footer, </b> is used to a enforce the layout information of a webpage instead of simply defining how it is presented. CSS is used for the aesthetics of the HTML language to present it to users. This specific usage of tags make up semantic structure.</p>

          <p>Now I have HTML, CSS, and DOM so can make an awesome webpage? It is not that simple to just type in some code. It s continuous process you write a code, test it and refine it over and over again to get a final result.</p>
