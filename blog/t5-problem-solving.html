      <h3 class="indextitle"><b>Problem Solving</b> </h3>   


      <h3> Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      
      <p>First simple problem was making my name appear with the Resume template provided by codecadmey.</p>   

      <p>The next biggest block was with the Racer assignment. First the big trouble was to capture an event on the webpage like mouse click or keypress and then pass it on to event handler to do the next logical function. With very limited knowledge I made an attempt by directly writing a script. Whatever I did at first nothing worked. Left frustrated after spending a whole day.</p>


      <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h4>

      <p>In the case of Resume, after going through the video and reading forum discussion in stackoverflow it all came to simple syntax. Important lesson learned, whenever you see "Uncaught error" check syntax or any typo with variables.</p> <br>

      <p>For the second issue with Racer it was long drawn. Afte googling and reading many stackoverflow and tyring out difference codes. Nothing worked. The poor ceramic duck withstood all my berating.  So I decided to start from scracth by doing a psuedocode first to get a clarity and then started the coding. Posted the issue with cohort. Got some tips from the fellow cohort. Then stepwise did the coding with console loggging at each stage and finally made it working. With this one critical issue I had to use all the weapons in the the arsnel, Psuedocode, Trying something, Rubber ducky method, Reading error messages
      Console.logging, Googling, Asking  peers and coaches for help, Improving your process with reflection. It was indeed a great learning. </p>

       <p> <b>Array.map()</b></p>

       <p>Suppose if you have a list of names with first and surname in an array and you want to just get only the first names in that array then in programming it is very common to iterate through that Array's contents, apply a function say get only first name to each item, and create a new array containing the results for all items. With <i>map()</i> method this is possible and we dont need a loop anymore and dont have to add  data to the array anymore. With map method the number of output elements is always equal to the input.</p>

       <p><b>Array.filter()</b></p> <br>

       <p>What if one wnat to transform some of the items in an array? With <i>map()</i> method it is not possible because it transforms all the items. For this purpose what one use is <i>filter()</i> method. However, one important difference is filter callback should be a boolean, whether to include original value in the result (true) or to leave it out (false). As one can see logically map and filter method can be chained. </p> 
        
       <p><b>Array.reduce()</b></p> <br>

       <p>OK you know filter can remove items, but what if one wants to add item to the output? For this reduce() method is used, despite what the name of this method implies. Unlike the map() and filter() methods reduce() always returns the array.</p>


       <p>So before closing I can explain how recursion compares to iteration.</p>

       <p>Roughly speaking, recursion and iteration repeats the same kind of task many times.</p>

       
       <p><i>Iteration:</i> keep repeating until a task is done.  Using a simple for loop to display the numbers from one to ten is an iterative process.</p>

       <p><i>Recursion</i> is a functions calls itself,  but with changed or reduced arguments. The recursive strategy of problem solving often yields elegant code more readable and 
       clear compared to other approaches. However, it has one shortcoming, its memory consumption to each recursive calls. An unbounding increasing of memory will stop the ability to execute as we run out of stack or what is called stack overflow.</p>
