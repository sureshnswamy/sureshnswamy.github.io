           <h3>So what is HTML, CSS and DOM?</h3>
      
          <p>Everyone is familiar reading a newspaper. Now if you recall a front page of a newspaper you will see rectangular boxes for each news or ad item with number columns interspersed. Now if you have to transform that on to a computer screen then you need some sort of tool to do that. Now for this purpose to first form the layout a skeleton structure of the page you use what is called <b>HTML</b> –(HyperText Markup Language). HTML is a computer code used to create documents on the web. This uses tags which place the text or image wherever you want to place. Tags are instructions that tell your browser what to show on a webpage. All tags start with a < and end with >. If you wish you can right click on this site and choose view page source. 
          
          <p>Now you have the skeleton structure but you what to add color, different font types, font size, position, orientation, and so on. To do those what you use is CSS- Cascading Style sheet. The cool thing about the <b>CSS</b> sheet if that you can link to an external style sheet and that can change the page for you. Just by editing the one style sheet you can modify a webpage.</p>
          
          <p>To have a better control on the way the webpage can be accessed to change the structure, style and content the modern way is to use <b>DOM</b> - Document Object Model. This is basically an interface that connects the webpages to scripts or programming language.</p>

      
          <h3>What is meant by boxifying design? </h3>

          <p>With the newspaper anology a paper layout is a boxes of different pictures and texts. Now each one of these box represents elements  and together they can be arranged to form a page. </p>

          <h3>What is box model?</h3>
        
          <p>Each every item that needs to go on to a page can all be put in different boxes. Bascially how an individual box element appears is controlled with CSS. The CSS Box model allows to define border of a box as well as the space between the boxes.</p>
