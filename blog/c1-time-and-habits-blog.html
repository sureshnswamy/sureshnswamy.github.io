<h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
<p>My approach to get a work done is more sort of a <a href= "http://pomodorotechnique.com/">promodoro</a> like focus on a particular task for say 30 mins and take a break. I tried to develop a habit instead of starting the day thinking I need to finish this today to just focused 5 minutes important step or work and this worked for me.</p>
<h3>What did you find interesting? </h3>

<p>The <a href= "http://www.foggmethod.com/">Fogg method</a> of developing habit is amazing. Also the flow psychology which I am used to but get tired after hours of work. I am working on that to change this habit.</p>
<h3>What worked for you?</h3>
<p>The promodoro approach Is what I tried so far so not sure yet whether that works for me.</p>
<h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
<p>The micro step approach along with the Foggs b=mat !! and try to improve upon a behaviour</p>
