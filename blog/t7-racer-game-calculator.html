      <h3> 1) What was your experience extending the racer game? </h3>
      
      <p>The first racer game based on table cell format took more than 6-10 hours. It was challenging  to understand event generation and even listener concept. Took few hours of struggle to get it correct. It was a good learning exercise to understand the difference between id and class naming for div. Various event methods like the keyboard and mouse and its handling to provide proper user experience. And finally to integrate the HTML-CSS JS and images on on separate folders to make them work smoothly as per the algorithm. From this to build on a new version then needed a bit of in-depth understanding of similar games. I found some good example of using the modern canvas tool for the developing my racer 2.0 version. I learnt most of  the useful methodologies  from <i><a href="https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-racer/">Jakes Gordon</a>. Moreover, I had already made an attempt to use canvas to develop a fun script to generate <a href ="http://sureshnswamy.github.io/random-circle/">random circle</a> using random colors was a big help to develop Racer 2.0. It was much of fun part to do a lot of physics stuff for motion control like speed, acceleration, turning, and bouncing on boundary. It to most of the time in developing and make it work using javascript. Then to make it more really I made a race track image to provide the background and also a race car image that moves on the track image. Finally made a couple of parameters to display with user control guide. It is a very basic game design and there is plenty of scope to develop and to learn further. Like how to control the motion with  respect to the image pixel, adding more object along the track, etc.</p>   

      <h3>2) Did you learn anything while building the calculator?</h3>

      <p>This exercise was part of the second pair programming assignment and I did this with <a href ="https://dominic-taylor.github.io/">Dominic Taylor</a>. We had the opportunity to half day in-person programming. We discussed our approach strategy and developed the skeleton structure quickly. Then added a basic style sheet and went to on to do the script. We were very flexible with the  driver-navigator roles and we did swap our roles along the way. This was by  exchanging  math function and keep on adding one by one to the code after testing each operators. There were opportunity to learn as well as teach during this pair programming. Overall a  very good experience and I look forward to do more like this. </p>
