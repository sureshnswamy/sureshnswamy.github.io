    <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>Listening to <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereefs Firesied</a> chat about the <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DBC</a> you will get the gist of what to expect of the entirely new experience in learning. Till then you might have a mindset of based on traditional learning experience which will change for sure altogether. My <a href="http://devacademy.co.nz/">EDA</a> experience so far is at times I am excited about the whole new experience in learning which showed some glimpse of what all you could achieve with small set of goals to reach. But also it shows how much is there to learn. </p>

      <p>When I came to know about EDA was bit skeptical that you won’t be getting any certificate that you can proudly hang on the wall. So what I get for the money I pay? It is the entirely new learning experience which is going to be with you for the best for of your life. In my opinion this is more valuable than a piece of certificate. </p>

      <p>Having said that there is an slippery undercurrent which keeps telling me that you don’t know almost of most of this stuff. For example see this blog no CSS style I am struggling at the moment. But this will change.</p>
