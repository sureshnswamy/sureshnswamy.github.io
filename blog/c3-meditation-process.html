          <p>Please read the previous part <a href="http://sureshnswamy.github.io/blog/c2-emotional-intelligence.html">Emotional Intelligence</a></p>

          <h5>Process over Product:</h5>

          <p> Redesigning this website using the new design concepts based on <a href ="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> utilities was bit of a challenge. It is not just copy and paste but to understand each element and tag functionality both in HTML and bringing the necessary aesthetics with CSS. Obviously the more refined the process the better will be the product. However, to produce a responsible website within six hours was bit of a struggle. I kept my focus to transform most of the design requirements on the wireframe drawing to the code. This imposed some constraints that I don’t understand many of the components because some may require javascript. The other key thing I kept in mind is to write a tidy code as much as possible. The overall take away message is it is an art to bring a balance between the process and the product</p>



          <h5>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
         
          <p>Personally I have exposure to different types of meditations. I highly regard meditation and tried to make it part of my daily routine. I am aware of its various benefits mainly to cope up with stress in day to day life and overall psychological wellbeing. </p>
         
          <h5>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h5>
          
          <p>After reading Chade Meng’s chapter 2 it provides an entirely different 
          perspective about meditation. Particularly the scientific evidence he lists like the measurable happiness level and the immunity development. Also the attentional-blink, and the enlargement of neocortex were all adding more evidence which are clearly tangible.</p>
          
          <h5>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
          
          <p>I like the muscle development analogy for meditation that growth will happen from overcoming resistance. I like this approach and I think it is easier to follow particularly to develop meta-attention.</p>
          
          <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
          
          <p>It is very clear breathing is the fundamental tool for this meditation. I would suggest by adding few pranayama- breathing control technique will help with meditation.</p>
